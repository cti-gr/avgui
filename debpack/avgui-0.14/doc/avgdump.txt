NAME
       avgdump - AVG crash dumper


DESCRIPTION
       avgdump  utility  is automatically executed if an AVG process crashes. Its purpose is to consult the daemon configuration, generate files containing information about the problem and/or a core
       dump, if possible, make a log entry into syslog, and exit. The crashed process is then terminated.

       The dumper logs information about an exception and its processing into syslog. All logs are logged into LOG_USER facility; the first row is logged with priority LOG_ERR,  all  other  rows  are
       logged with priority LOG_INFO. Some info rows may be omitted if carry no information.


NOTE
       Please note that avgdump might need gdb or ulimit set to unlimited based on its configuration to work properly. See the "LIST OF ACTIONS" section below.


CONFIGURATION
       avgdump configuration is located in the $AVGINSTDIR/cfg/dump.ini file.  Each AVG binary can have its own section with description of actions performed after the crash.

       There are three default sections:
       [default32] for 32bit processes,
       [default64] for 64bit processes and
       [default] which applies to all binaries

       If  there  is  no specific section for an application then depending on whether the application is 32bit or 64bit, either contents of [default32] or [default64] is used. If that section is not
       present, [default] section is used.


LIST OF ACTIONS
       EXIT After processing all other actions, instruct the crashing program to exit without prompting the system to generate core dump.

       CRASH After processing all other actions, instruct the crashing program to terminate so that the system generates a dump (if administrator enabled generating core dumps for crashing programs).

       GDB_BT Use gdb to generate backtraces of all process threads.  If 'gdb_bg_path' option is specified, use the path provided as a path to gdb binary in this action.

       GDB_SO Use gdb to generate a list of shared libraries loaded by the process.  If 'gdb_so_path' option is specified, use the path provided as a path to gdb binary in this action.

       GDB_INFO Use gdb to generate both backtraces of all processes, and a list of shared libraries loaded by the process.  If 'gdb_info_path' option is specified, use the path provided as a path to
       gdb binary in this action.

       GDB_DUMP  Use gdb to generate the same information as GDB_INFO action does, and also a core dump.  If 'gdb_dump_path' option is specified, use the path provided as a path to gdb binary in this
       action.

       GCORE_DUMP Use the gcore tool to generate core dump (freebsd only).  If 'gcore_dump_path' option is specified, use the path provided as a path to gcore binary in this action.

       SOL_BT Use the pstack tool to generate backtrace (solaris only).

       MODULES Generate file containing a list of modules loaded to the crashed process memory.

       INFO Store information about the process and details about the failure.

       AVG_DIAG After processing all actions, upload the crash information to AVG Crash Portal.

       DEFAULT Equals to the following combination of commands: INFO (all platforms), MODULES (solaris), SOL_BT (solaris), GDB_INFO (non-solaris), CRASH (all platforms).

       gdb_bt_path = /my/path/to/gdb
       gdb_so_path = /my/different/path/to/gdb
